* The exploit here is easy: as the hint suggests, we should check the program checks if the player won.
* It checks it by using strstr() function, that returns a pointer to the first occurrence in the haystack (given string) of the needle (checked string).
* The problem here is at the strstr() function, because if we give the following string as the needle - "paperscissorsrock", it contains all the possible guesses that the computer can guess -> and strstr() will always return a pointer to the first occurrence (pointer = address)
* Because the program doesn't check what strstr() returns, with the given needle above, it will always return an address (pointer), which will result in true.
* We abuse this 5 times in a row, and we get the precious flag:
